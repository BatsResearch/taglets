Jeff:
- GPU in controller or taglet? we should make use_gpu consistent for train and execute
- pep8 warnings
- cleaning code

Peilin:
- the end model should be trained based on both predictions based on labelmatrix and  labeled images

Top:
- active learning module (least confience)

Elaheh:
- add prototyep framework
- use trained model during base phase for adaptation phase
- add pre-train + finetune taglet for TransferTaglet
- use scads to dataset
- complete a complete JPL process (3 base phases + 3 adapt phases)
- top 5 accuracy, mean accuracy
- CIFAR100 data?!

Unaasigned:
- complete readme file
- unit test
- add docstring
