- GPU in controller or taglet? we should make use_gpu consistent for train and execute
- (Peilin)the end model should be trained based on both predictions based on labelmatrix and  labeled images
- use trained model during base phase for adaptation phase
- pep8 warnings
- (Top) active learning module (least confience)
- complete readme file
- test units
- add docstring
- complete execute function in taglet on all unlabeled data
- add pre-train + finetune taglet for TransferTaglet
- connect scads to dataset
- update transforms for MNIST(train test val)
- complete a complete JPL process (3 base phases + 3 adapt phases)
- top 5 accuracy, mean accuracy
- CIFAR100 data?!
