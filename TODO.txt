- pep8 warnings
- cleaning code
- complete readme file
- unit test
- add docstring
- run the whole process in a server with GPU
- active learning for grayscale not rgb, use dataloader in active learning
- test the accuracy of dataloader, splits, etc
- in adapt phase, load pretrined model
- add pre-train + finetune taglet for TransferTaglet
- top 5 accuracy, mean accuracy
- complete a complete JPL process (3 base phases + 3 adapt phases)
- CIFAR100 data?!




Notes to discuss:
- train end model on both labeled and unlabled data
- end model validation and test
- util python file
- I assume that we have both val and test data for few shot learning
- model zoo and external datasets
